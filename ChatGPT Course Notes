Lesson: Prompt Engineering:

Tokens: ChatGPT understands tokens not words.
Tempratature: Degree of Randomness in generating next token. If high, next token will be very random/gibberish. If low, it will be definitive.
Maximum Length: Total number of tokens that ChatGPT will generate. 
Top P: Another metric to control randomness. This controls smallest subset of tokens whose sum of probabilities >= the specified input metric. Expressed as a number between 0 - 1. 
Frequency Penalty: Controls the frequencies of words returned. If high, less/no words will be repeated.
Presence Penalty: Factor which makes it stick to subject in question. If high, noise will be reduced. 


Best Tips for Good Prompting - 
* Make ChatGPT pretend to be an expert
  Eg "Consider that you are a doctor"

* Define your objective as specifically as possible. Provide as much context as possible. 
* Ask your answers in a certain format eg - Table, Bullet Points, Paragraphs.
* Prompt by example when it becomes difficult to explain the format. Provide an example in those circumstances.
* When not getting good responses, ask ChatGPT to ask you questions to improve your question in the first place.
* Refine your answers and counter question.
