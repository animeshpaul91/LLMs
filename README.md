### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd All-about-LLMs
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in each project directory:
   ```

   ```

3. **Install dependencies for specific modules**
   ```bash
   # For basics module
   cd "AI App Development/explore-openai/basics"
   poetry install
   poetry shell

   # For prompt engineering
   cd "../prompt-engineering"
   poetry install
   poetry shell

   # For Streamlit chat UI
   cd "../streamlit-chat-ui"
   poetry install
   poetry shell
   ```
