Open Roth IRA on Fidelity.
Max out 401k
Max out HSA.


Criteria to look for before investing in stocks - 
1. Interest coverage ratio = Operating Income / Interest Expense. (The higher the better. You want > 6 ideally) (See Summary tab on MorningStar)
2. Debt to Assets ratio (The lower the better. You want < 0.75 ideally) (See Financials -> Balance Sheet tab on MorningStar)
3. Debt Payback Time = Long-Term Debt / Free Cash Flow. 
   To find Long-Term Debt, Go to Financials -> Balance sheet and expand to search for "Total Long Term Debt".
   To find free cash flow, go to Financials -> Cash Flow, and see from the summary. Do not expand. 
   As of  now, it's 0.99. This means it will take 0.99 ~ 1 year for Apple to pay off all it's debt. Try to keep this as reasonably less as possible.

If the company passes steps 1, 2 & 3 then - 

4. Check EPS. The higher the better. (See Financials -> Income Statement tab on MorningStar)
5. Most important profitability metric - ROIC (Expressed as a %): Return on Invested Capital. You want to look for > 10%. (See Operating Performance tab on MorningStar)
6. If all of the above tests pass, determine if the stock is rightly priced or how cheaply priced using the PE Ratio. 
   PE Ratio = Stock Price / EPS (Metric # 4)
   The lower it is, the cheaper it is. A good rule of thumb is PE ratio < 15. t helps to compare a stock’s PE ratio with its historical average, as well as with industry averages. The lower the PE Ratio, the more of a bargain you’re getting! A low PE Ratio indicates that the stock is cheap relative to the earnings that it generates.
   On MorningStar, Go to the "Valuation" tab or just the summary page to see the "Price/Earnings" metric.

Questions for Fidelity: 
1. Does my plan track source of Funds or source balances separately?
2. How long does in service rollover take? I'm planning to roll over to Roth IRA the same day the funds go inside in my after-tax 401k, without earning any gains on those contributions? I want to avoid doing a partial rollover.
3. Mega backdoor Roth - Process a rollover.
