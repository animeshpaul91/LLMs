/*
	Tips for writing good unit tests:
	1. Readability/Clarity - Name the methods very well. It should reflect what the test is doing.
	2. Write your Unit Tests in such a way that they should fail only when there is something wrong with application code.
	In other words, unit tests must not fail erroneously.
	3. Use BDD-style testing.
