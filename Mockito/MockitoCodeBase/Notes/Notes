Stubs are Good. But their major drawbacks are:
1. They fail with dynamic conditioning as their implementations increase in size with more testing scenarios.
2. They do not define services well.

What is Mocking?
--> Mocking is creating objects that simulate the behavior of real objects.
--> Unlike stubs, mocks can be dynamically created from code - at runtime.
--> Mocks offer more functionality than stubbing.
 --> You can verify method calls and a lot of other things.
