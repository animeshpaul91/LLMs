## Creating Goals

### Define Your Goals
- Goals should be **SMART**:
  - **Specific** â€“ Clearly define what you want to accomplish.
  - **Measurable** â€“ Ensure there is a way to track progress.
  - **Attainable** â€“ Set realistic and achievable objectives.
  - **Relevant** â€“ Align with your larger purpose and ambitions.
  - **Time-Based** â€“ Every goal should have a **deadline**.

ðŸš€ Take control of your time, align your life with your passions, and build your dream life step by step!



## The Illusion of Time

### Do not be cent-wise dollar foolish. Saving 20 secs will not be of substantial value. Anything that takes less than 3 mins is not worth saving.

### Saving Time v/s Wasting Time:
 - Avoid any activity (other than work) which requires a lot of focus. That is taking away your attention reducing your attention currency.
 - Focus on those activities first which require minimum effort and which yields maximum output.
 - Bundle different activities together (listening to music, news, podcast and working out together). Try to fulfill multiple pillars of happiness by bundling activities.

### Don't swim against the flow:
 - Every environment has it's own preferences. Figure out the preferred activity for the environment you are in. Or else you will need more effort.
