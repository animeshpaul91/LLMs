### Maximizing output with minimal effort

**The 80-20 Rule**
- The 80-20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, states that 80% of outcomes result from 20% of causes. In other words, a small percentage of efforts (20%) often lead to the majority of results (80%).
- 80% of a company’s revenue comes from 20% of its customers.
- 80% of a project’s value is delivered by 20% of the features.
- 80% of the world’s wealth is owned by 20% of the population.
- In sales, 80% of profits often come from 20% of clients.


### Amount of Work Done is directly proportional to Time Spent * Level of Focus


### Why you always need a deadline?
- Create Artificial deadlines for yourself.
- Create To-Do lists for the day and week. Use the Tick Tick App.
- Create an Eisenhower Matrix

| Urgency/Importance | Urgent    | Not Urgent |  
|--------------------|-----------|------------|  
| Important          | Do it now | Schedule a time to do it |  
| Not Important      | Delegate  | Delete |


### Rule of the One
- Address the most important work of the day.
- Use the `Rule of the One` Prioritize the most important and the most urgent task of the day. Then think about three other tasks you can do in the day. 


### Rule of three
- Once you address the most important work of the day, try to tackle three smaller tasks. You will have momentum going.
- Club smaller tasks one after one. This is called task clubbing.

### Balance your pillars
- Always balance your pillars of happiness. 
- If you spent 4 hours of deep focused work in a day, make sure you allot time for activities that counterbalance the deep work. 
- Examples include - physical exercise, taking a walk, music, traveling. Or else you will be burnt out. Allow to relax your body and mind.
- Aim for sustainable productivity. It will be maximum when your happiness is also maximum. Do not be overly strict. Have a rough plan.
- The environment that you setup has to be conducive to your work/study. There needs to be sufficient natural light. Makes your environment offer no/least resistance.


### Stopping Procrastination Forever. Eliminating distractions.
- Avoid all forms of Social Media - Instagram, Facebook, YouTube. If you cannot avoid it 100%, have a dedicated time for these and do not spill over this time.
- Do NOT **passively watch** TV for long hours. Actively choose what to watch. Similar to social media, have a dedicated time for wayching TV (only content that you want to actively watch).
- Do not watch any content in social media during work breaks (lunch etc).


### The Golden currency of Attention.
- Attention is limited. Everyday you can concentrate only for a certain amount of time. You need to conserve this attention currency as much as you can to focus on important tasks.
- Think of Attention as a fixed quota for the day. You have to manage/conserve your mental focus.


### Just Do It.
- Sucking at something is the first step to becoming kind of good at it. Just start!
- Perfect is the enemy of good. **Always prioritize Progress over Perfection.** The 80-20 rule is relevant here.
- Set benchmarks of `Manageable Difficuly` for your tasks when you start.
- Start with benchmarks being not so easy, but not too hard either, so that you can complete them with some effort.


### Learn to be bored.
- Attention is a currency.
- You become more aware of your surroundings.
- This creates stronger and more persistent memories.
- You mind is completely `clutter free`. Taking a shower is a good time for creative ideas.
- Do NOT cruise your life on Auto-Pilot. Do all tasks consciously. Live intentionally.
