### Maximizing output with minimal effort

**The 80-20 Rule**
- The 80-20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, states that 80% of outcomes result from 20% of causes. In other words, a small percentage of efforts (20%) often lead to the majority of results (80%).
- 80% of a company’s revenue comes from 20% of its customers.
- 80% of a project’s value is delivered by 20% of the features.
- 80% of the world’s wealth is owned by 20% of the population.
- In sales, 80% of profits often come from 20% of clients.


### Amount of Work Done is directly proportional to Time Spent * Level of Focus


### Why you always need a deadline?
- Create Artificial deadlines for yourself.
- Create To-Do lists for the day and week. Use the Tick Tick App.
- Create an Eisenhower Matrix

| Urgency/Importance | Urgent    | Not Urgent |  
|--------------------|-----------|------------|  
| Important          | Do it now | Schedule a time to do it |  
| Not Important      | Delegate  | Delete |


### Rule of the One
- Address the most important work of the day.


### Rule of three
- Once you address the most important work of the day, try to tackle three smaller tasks. You will have momentum going.
- Club smaller tasks one after one. This is called task clubbing.

### Balance your pillars
- Always balance your pillars of happiness. 
- If you spent 4 hours of deep focused work in a day, make sure you allot time for activities that counterbalance the deep work. 
- Examples include - physical exercise, taking a walk, music, traveling. Or else you will be burnt out. Allow to relax your body and mind.
- Aim for sustainable productivity. It will be maximum when your happiness is also maximum. Do not be overly strict. Have a rough plan.
