### Maximizing output with minimal effort

**The 80-20 Rule**
- The 80-20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, states that 80% of outcomes result from 20% of causes. In other words, a small percentage of efforts (20%) often lead to the majority of results (80%).
- 80% of a company’s revenue comes from 20% of its customers.
- 80% of a project’s value is delivered by 20% of the features.
- 80% of the world’s wealth is owned by 20% of the population.
- In sales, 80% of profits often come from 20% of clients.
