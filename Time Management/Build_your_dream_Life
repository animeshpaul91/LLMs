Balancing your life and the ultimate dream:

The Journey matters more than the destination. Ambitions should not be geared or driven towards just the end goal, but more importantly, the jouney. 

The most precious resource in life is time. Focus on your typical week and then think about the ideal week that you want. 


Creating Goals:
Define your Goals. Goals have to be SMART - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Based (It should have a deadline).
