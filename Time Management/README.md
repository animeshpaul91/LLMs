**üéØ Create SMART Goals**

| Criteria | Description | Questions to Consider |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Specific** | The goal should be clear and specific, answering exactly what is to be achieved. | What do I want to accomplish? Why is this goal important? Who is involved? Where is it located? What resources or limits are involved? |
| **Measurable** | There should be a way to measure progress and know when the goal has been achieved. | How much? How many? How will I know when it is accomplished? |
| **Achievable** | The goal should be realistic and attainable, considering available resources and constraints. | How can I accomplish this goal? What are the steps involved? |
| **Relevant** | The goal should matter and align with broader objectives, ensuring it contributes to a larger purpose. | Does this goal matter to me? Is it the right time? Does it align with other relevant goals? |
| **Time-bound** | The goal should have a clear deadline or timeframe to create a sense of urgency and help track progress. | When will it be achieved? What can I do six months from now? What can I do today? |

**‚úÖ Create Your Own SMART Goals Below**

| Description of Goal | Daily Task |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Goal 1 | Run 4 miles in 45 minutes, 4 times a week & 15 mins of breathing exercises daily for the next 4 months to reduce visceral fat. |
| Goal 2 | Practice guitar for 30 minutes, 5 times a week for the next 4 months to master guitar chords to play simple songs with easier chord progressions just by listening to them. |
| Goal 3 | Read a book for 1 hour daily to learn and gain knowledge on any topic. |

Example of a SMART Goal: Instead of setting a vague goal like *"Improve my fitness,"* a SMART goal would be: *"Run 3 miles in 30 minutes, 4 times a week for the next 3 months."*
