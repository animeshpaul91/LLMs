My daughter takes this plush toy everywhere, and its softness and cuteness are truly remarkable. However, I observed that one of the ears is slightly lower than the other, which does not appear to be an intentional design choice. Additionally, the size of the plush toy is somewhat smaller than anticipated, considering the price. There may be larger alternatives available at a similar cost. On a positive note, the item arrived a day earlier than expected, allowing me the opportunity to enjoy it briefly before gifting it to my daughter.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Formatting**: This includes specific guidelines for margins, font size and type (typically Times New Roman, 12-point), line spacing (double-spaced), and page headers.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Title Page**: An APA-style paper usually includes a title page with the title of the paper, the author's name, and the institutional affiliation.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Abstract**: A brief summary of the research paper, usually no more than 250 words, that provides an overview of the main points.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Headings**: APA style uses a specific system of headings and subheadings to organize content, which helps in structuring the paper clearly.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **In-text Citations**: When referencing other works, APA style uses the author-date citation method, where the author's last name and the year of publication are included in the text.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Reference List**: At the end of the document, a reference list provides full details of all sources cited in the paper. This includes the author's name, publication year, title of the work, and publication details.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Tables and Figures**: APA style provides specific guidelines for the presentation of tables and figures, including labeling and captioning.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Bias-Free Language**: APA emphasizes the use of inclusive and bias-free language, encouraging writers to avoid language that might be considered discriminatory or biased.\n",
       "\n",
       "These guidelines are detailed in the \"Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association,\" which is regularly updated to reflect changes in writing and publishing standards. The most recent edition, as of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, is the 7th edition."
